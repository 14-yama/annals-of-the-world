Genesis 2:7

According to Jewish sources, Adam was the first to choose the Cave of the Machpelah as his burial place “under and inside of the cave.” The Midrash reports:

Adam sat and pondered and he said, ”For I know that You will return me to die and at meeting place of all living” (Job 30:23). “As long as I am still alive I will build a house outside of Mt. Moria.” He dug and built himself a house. Then he thought, these tablets (the Ten Commandments) which will be written by the hand of G-d will chase away the waters of the Jordan river; my body-made by G-d’s own hands and given a soul by Him. After my death my body and my bones will be taken and be made into idolatry. So, therefore, I will bury my casket deep under and inside the cave. Therefore, the Cave is called the Cave of the Machpelah-The Multiple Cave and there is where they are: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. And therefore it is called Kiryat Arba -the city of the four- because four couples were buried there.
