Adam sat and pondered and he said, ”For I know that You will return me to die and at meeting place of all living” (Job 30:23). “As long as I am still alive I will build a house outside of Mt. Moria.” He dug and built himself a house. Then he thought, these tablets (the Ten Commandments) which will be written by the hand of G-d will chase away the waters of the Jordan river; my body-made by G-d’s own hands and given a soul by Him. After my death my body and my bones will be taken and be made into idolatry. So, therefore, I will bury my casket deep under and inside the cave. Therefore, the Cave is called the Cave of the Machpelah-The Multiple Cave and there is where they are: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. And therefore it is called Kiryat Arba -the city of the four- because four couples were buried there.

Adam sat and pondered and he said :”For I know that You will return me to die and at meeting place of all living” (Job 30:23). “As long as I am still alive I will build a house outside of Mt. Moria. He dug and built himself a house. Then he thought, these tablets (the Ten Commandments) which will be written by the hand of G-d will chase away the waters of the Jordan river; my body-made by G-d’s own hands and given a soul by Him. After my death my body and my bones will be taken and be made into idolatry. So, therefore, I will bury my casket deep under and inside the cave. Therefore, the Cave is called the Cave of the Machpelah-The Multiple Cave and there is where they are: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekak, Jacob and Leah. And therefore it is called Kiryat Arba -the city of the four- because four couples were buried there.

Genesis 38:3
 	 	 	 	Er married Tamar.

Genesis 38 - Tamar was Jesus' 41st great grandmother according to Matthew's genealogy. According to Luke she was his 50th great grandmother.

Jewish law dictated that when a man died his brother was bound to marry the widow. That insured that the deceased man's line would be continued. After the death of her first husband, Tamar married Judah's second son. However, after the second son died, Judah did not want her to marry his third son, because he feared that son would also die. The ancient Jews were very superstitious, and believed that there was an evil spirit that entered the bed chamber and killed husbands. So, Tamar posed as a prostitute and tricked Judah into sleeping with her. When she became pregnant and revealed herself to Judah, he was ashamed that he had treated her so badly. She became her father-in-law's wife and bore him twin sons, Perez (Jesus' ancestor) and Zerah.

He dug and built himself a house. Then he thought, these tablets (the Ten Commandments) which will be written by the hand of G-d will chase away the waters of the Jordan river; my body-made by G-d’s own hands and given a soul by Him. After my death my body and my bones will be taken and be made into idolatry. So, therefore, I will bury my casket deep under and inside the cave. Therefore, the Cave is called the Cave of the Machpelah-The Multiple Cave and there is where they are: Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebeckah, Jacob and Leah. And therefore it is called Kiryat Arba -the city of the four- because four couples were buried there.

Exodus 15:20
Deuteronomy 34

Led the Hebrews out of Egypt in 1290 BC (http://www.cresourcei.org/keydates.html). He received the ten commandments from God (twice).

His death date comes from a computerized Jewish/English calendar I downloaded from the Aish.com Jewish web site. In a newsletter from that same site in May, 2006 they also stated that Moses was born on February 25. However, the calendar did not show that.

Moses married (1) Zipporah daughter of Jethro (Reuel) in 1312 BC in ,,,Midian.

Genesis 2:16-21
Some Bible scholars wonder if Jethro and Reuel could be two different people. There is some speculation that Reuel could be the father of the "Cushite woman" and that she was a second wife of Moses.

Another speculation is that Jethro might have died and Reuel took his place as the patriarch of his people. According to the way ancient peoples looked at relationships, Reuel might have been though of as Moses' father-in-law after Jethro died.

Moses and Zipporah had the following children:

+	513	M	i	Gershom was born in 1302 BC.
+	514	M	ii	Eliezer.
Moses married (2) A Cushite Woman.

Numbers 12:1

Aaron and Miriam rebelled against Moses because of this marriage. Is this woman the same person as Zipporah? There are people on both sides of the argument. I refer you to the article "Moses: The Private Man Behind the Public Leader," J. Daniel Hays, "Bible Review," August 2000. This article discusses the issue of Moses' Cushite wife in detail and cites other references. Does this make Moses a polygamist? I will let you decide that for yourself.

Joshua 14:6 - Caleb is described as a "Kenizzite," i.e., he was not one of the Israelites who left Egypt. Apparently, he joined the Israelites soon after they left Egypt. (Within the first two years.) The confusing part about this is that Caleb is listed in the tribe of Judah in Numbers 13:6. But then, there didn't seem to be a tribe just for those who joined the Israelites during their wanderings.

Ruth 4:20, 1 Chronicles 2:10

Salmon married Rahab.

Joshua 2:1-24; 6:25; Matthew 1:5 - Rahab was Jesus' 35th great grandmother according to Matthew's genealogy. According to Luke she was his 44th great grandmother. She was not a Hebrew. She was a resident of Jerico when the Hebrews were attacking the city. There are two interpretations about who she really was. One interpretation is that she was an inn keeper and/or a prostitute. She helped Joshua's spies escape from Jericho before they were captured. For this act her life and the lives of all in her family were spared when Jericho was captured and destroyed. Another interpretation says that she was probably not the same Rachel who helped the spies, but rather was a different woman. The reason for this confusion is because some traditions say that the Rehab who helped the spies later married Joshua. There is no Biblical basis for this and Joshua is not listed as an ancestor of Jesus. The ancestor of Jesus is another Hebrew named Salmon (Salma). Matther gives Salmon's wife's name as Rahab. It is safe to say that Biblical "experts" are confused about this issue. I leave it to others to resolve the question.

Salmon and Rahab had the following children:

1 Chronicles 4:13 - Judges 3:9 - Othniel, the first deliverer (Judge) in the Book of Judges was probably not an Israelite.

Matthew 1:12-16

Joseph married Mary daughter of Heli.

Matthew 1:12-16 - Mary is very familiar to us. She was not married to Joseph when the Holy Spirit came upon her and she conceived the baby Jesus. I hope you do not need a biblical reference for Mary, but if you do you can send me an email message. I will give you several.

Joseph and Mary had the following children:

 	1205	M	i	Jesus was born in 0006 BC in Bethlehem. He died in 0030 in Jerusalem. He was buried in Jerusalem.

Matthew 1:12-16

Four Brothers are listed for Jesus in Matthew 13:55 and Mark 6:3. Their names are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas. The passages also indicate that he had sisters, but they are not named. Controversy has raged through the ages concerning these siblings.

Some people take these Bible passages as written and accept that Mary and Joseph had several other children after Jesus was born. Others maintain that Mary was a virgin all her life and had no other children. They believe that the Joseph had already been married once and the children were produced in that marriage. That would make them Jesus’ half brothers and sisters.

Yet another theory is that the words “brother” and “sister” really referred to cousins or other closely related people. One view I have read suggests that “brother” and “sister” are used just like certain religious groups use them today to refer to members of the congregation.

I do not mind stating my opinion about this. I believe that they were full brothers and sisters of Jesus just as the biblical passages say. I refer you to a book named The Brother of Jesus, by Hershel Shanks and Ben Witherington, Harper Collings Publishers, Inc., San Francisco, California, 2003. It discusses this in depth.
